# Stroke-Data-Visualization
This repository contains a data mining project that analyzes stroke data from multiple groups of individuals. Using various visualization techniques, we explore the relationships and correlations between different factors such as age, gender, and lifestyle habits, to better understand the patterns and risk factors associated with strokes.
